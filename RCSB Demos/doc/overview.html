<h1>RCSB Demos</h1>
<p>
A collection of demonstrations of the MBT lib and potentially various kinds of
viewers and/or analyses, other kinds of packages.</p>
<p>
These can also serve as tests - in particular the MBT Demos can be used to
check isolation of the model from Swing or Jogl intrusions.</p>
