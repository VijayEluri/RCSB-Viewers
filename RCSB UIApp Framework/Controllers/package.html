<title>RCSB UIApp Framework - Controllers</title>

<body>
<p>
<em>Controllers</em> are a category of software that basically controls flow, direction, and defines
relationships in the application.</p>
<p>
The 'AppBase' class serves as a 'master controller', via which all of the other controllers and
other architectural components are available.  Applications derive their App controller from that
(usually named the same as the application), and provide a main.</p>
<p>
Other controllers handle doc loading, updating, and other functions as necessary.</p>
