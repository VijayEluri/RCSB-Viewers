      README - Documentation on the Documentation
    </h1>
    <p>
      The documentation for the viewers has been lifted out of the build projects for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's <em>PHP</em> driven to allow breakouts of things like headers, navigation bars, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's comprehensive - all of the documentation for all of the viewers is here.
      </li>
      <li>
        It allows the documentation to easily be copied <em>en-masse</em>, or zipped or otherwised packaged without
        having to include the source files.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      <em>PHP</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>PHP</em> is used to allow sectioning up of the documents. Headers, trailers, nav bars, etc. are much more
      easily implemented as separate entities that only need to be defined once, and are incorporated in the final
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, we don't want to require the end user to put <em>PHP</em> and an <em>Apache</em> server on his machine
      (although, more and more, this is becoming the case.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we run an Ant script which processes the pages and outputs static HTML pages to the <em>doc-out</em>
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Development and editing occurs on the <em>doc-in</em> page. If you want to view those pages, directly, you can
      do that - you'll
      need an installation of Apache and PHP (provided by default in Mac installations, BTW), or use eclipse configured
      with a browser and PHP.</p>
    <p>
      You also need to make the 'src' directory accessible to the web browser.  An easy way to do that (on unix or mac)
      is to go to whereever you document root is defined and create a link to the src directory.</p>
    <p>
      For browsing the src, you <em>must first</em> visit the 'src/index.php' file - this registers a session and sets
      session variables that allow the rest of the pages to get the correct include for the various PHP bits.  You'll
      get lots of errors, if you don't visit this page, first.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Note that all of the links on the pages are relative - this allows the output pages to be placed anywhere (at a
    	cost disadvantage of ability to reorganize the pages.  Trade-offs...)
