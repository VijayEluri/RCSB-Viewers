<title>RCSB Viewers - PDB Kiosk</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The <em>PDB Kiosk</em> is a 'show' viewer - it runs through a set of structures and displays them
in slide-show fashion, moving the camera in smooth animations to view the current structure from
different angles and attributes.  In addition, it will focus in on any non-structural molecules.
A panel at the base provides author and other information.</p>
<p>
This viewer is driven by either:</p>
<ul>
<li> a file in it's current directory (called screensaver.properties) to
point to a directory containing structure files.</li>
<li> a file in that directory called files.txt, naming files or bare structure ids
<li> a list of structures provided after the argument <em>-structure-id-list</em>, comma separated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When only structure id's are present, they are downloaded from the <em>RCSB PDB Website</em>.  See the
source documentation for details.</p>
<p>
Note that to debug the PDB Kiosk, you have to use two machines and debug remotely, since it puts the display in
full-screen mode.  Read the <em>Eclipse</em> documentation (or whatever development environment
you're working in) for instructions on how to do that.</p>
