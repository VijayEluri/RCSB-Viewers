<p>
The <em>Simple Viewer</em> presents a structure in a window with no UI other than the menu bar.  It's useful for
simply displaying (and manipulating) a structure in the largest frame possible, without any other interaction.</p>
<p>
This viewer would be a good candidate to re-introduce applet functionality (which was removed in the re-architect
effort, since it doesn't require any other
interaction than display and basic 3d manipulation.
