<title>RCSB Viewers - Ligand Explorer</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The <em>Ligand Explorer</em> presents a structure and non-structure molecules, with a user interface
panel to highlight and display several measurements between atoms of a ligand and atoms of the structure.</p>
<p>
This viewer implements a number of extended classes to provide things like annotated atoms and interactions.
These features might be useful to be pushed down into the Viewer Framework, or lower.</p>
<p>
Conversely, there has been discussion of creating a single 'unified' viewer.  This viewer would probably
be the best starting point for such an effort - it shouldn't be too difficult to pull the <em>Protein Workshop</em>
control panel in, and have another selection in the menu item to hide controls, entirely - providing
<em>Simple Viewer</em> functionality.</p>
<p>
Rendering styles would have to be changed when entering and exiting <em>Ligand Explorer</em> mode.
