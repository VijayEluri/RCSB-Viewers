Viewers Documentation Project
-----------------------------
19-Jan-09 - rickb

This project is a 'pseudo-java' project - the only thing it uses is the javadoc.xml ant script
to generate javadoc documentation for the viewers.

The 'src' and 'reference' top level directories provide input to javadoc, on a per-project basis.

The output is in the 'doc' top-level directory, and is also generated on a per-project basis.

Note the output dirs below 'doc' are excluded from SVN, since they're generated from the ant script.
