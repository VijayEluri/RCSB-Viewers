jogl jnilibs -
rickb - initial version: 16-Oct-08

These are the jnilibs re-jar'd and expanded for two purposes:

  - The expanded versions for most common 32bit environments are
	  immediately available for running from the commandline.
    The TestRun scripts reference these.  If you want to run the
    64bit or the sparc versions, you'll need to do the following:

      cp jogl-<version>-<arch>/lib/* .

    The TestRun scripts should then run.  Note you have to do this
    again for the 32 bit OS, if you go back to that.

  - The re-jar'd files are available for the Java WebStart mechanism.
    Note these have to be signed first, and then copied into the
    webapp project (see the 'signjars.xml' ant file here for signing
    and the 'FetchSignedViewerJars.xml' ant file in the pdbweb project
    for copying the signed jars up to pdbweb.

Java Webstart is a bit more of an issue.  At least on Linux, 64 bit
webstart isn't supported.  Presumably it will be in the future, and
when it is, we should be ready for it with already signed jars.  Unfortunately,
the names conflict with the 32 bit versions, so some further separation and
organization is needed.

64 bit Windows is an unknown as we haven't tried it under Vista on a
dual-core machine, yet.
