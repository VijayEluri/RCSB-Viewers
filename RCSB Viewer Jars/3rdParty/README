3rdParty
rickb - 17-Oct-08

Third party jars and jnilibs (currently jogl only) are here.

Read the jnilibs README for more information on jni handling.

REGENERATING UNSIGNED JARS
--------------------------
If the certificate in pdbkeys has expired, you need to regenerate the keys.

Run the 'mkjars' script (.csh) in jnilibs, it will replace all of the jni jars.
It should also replace the following jars in this directory:

  jogl.jar
  gluegen-rt.jar
  jai_core.jar
  jai_codec.jar
  
Run jarsigner ('jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs <name>.jar) to verify the new jars
are clean.
  
Next time you run the 'signjars.xml' file, these should be re-signed along with
the RCSBViewer and RCSBSupport jars.
