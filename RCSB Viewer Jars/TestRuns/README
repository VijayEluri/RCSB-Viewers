TestRuns
rickb - 17-Oct-08

These are standalone scripts that reference a default pdb file and
bring up the viewer.  You can specify a PDB file on the commandline,
if you wish.  For Ligand Explorer (lxtest) you can also specify a
ligand as the second argument.

Environment:
-----------
These reference the jars and jnilibs in the ../3rdParty and
../3rdParty/jnilib dirs, respectively.

If you need to run on a 64bit or sparc architecture (or if things
just don't run), go to the ../3rdParty/jnilib and view the README
to get the correct shared binaries into the ../3rdParty/jnilib dir.

Enjoy
