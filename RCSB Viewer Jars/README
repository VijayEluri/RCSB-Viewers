----------
This directory is a staging area for production.  It's used to coalesce
all the jars before signing, and to provide a quick-run test
environment.

Summary Jar Locations:
----------------------
3rd Party - these are done by hand as needed.
RCSBSupport - MBT and Viewer Framework jars
RCSBViewers - viewers jars

Some notes:
-----------
To run the canned tests, cd down to TestRuns.  Run one of the following:

 -lxtest - Ligand Explorer
 -svtest - Simple Viewer
 -pwtest - Protein Workshop Viewer
 -kstest - Kiosk Viewer

A 'tcsh' and '.bat' file are provided for each viewer, so you can run on
unix/mac and windows.

svtest points to a huge biological unit, and is dog slow.  This will be a
good target to work on for performance enhancements.

enjoy.
