<h1>Excluded Source</h1>
<p>
This project contains source that has been excluded from the libs for various reasons, either
it is obsolete or it is an external process.  If the former, it is here because we may want
to reinstate it in some form in the future, but we don't want to lose it.</p>
<p>
Folders are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>CL Tools</dt>
<dd>
Command line tools used to generate something used by the MBT.  These are:
<ul>
<li>ChemicalComponentBondsCreator.java - creates the ChemicalComponentBonds.dat (bonds dictionary).</li>
<li>FindAll NucleicAcidCompoundNames.java - creates the Nucleic Acid Info list.</li>
</ul>
<dt>Structure Loader</dt>
<dd>
LoaderFactory and cid/fasta loaders - none of this was used (unfortunately, I might add - I thought the
LoaderFactory was a good concept.)</dd>
</dl>
