This testbed is something I ginned together to test some of the graphics functions and work out a rotation
problem w/ double bonds independently of the viewers.</p>
<p>
In the spirit of getting the most out of any endeavor, I've also used it to test a couple of architectural
ideas that I think would be good to get into the viewers.</p>
<h2>Project Organization</h2>
<p>
The TestBed project is organized pretty much along the same lines as the viewers, with an 'app', 'controllers'
'glscene', 'UI' sections, and an additional 'util' section.  They're just in packages rather than separated out
in folders because the codebase is significantly smaller.</p>
<p>
What is new is the addition of the {@linkplain com.kis.testbed.controllers.IActiveFrame} controller - an abstract
interface that defines the kind of functionality such a facility would require.  In this case, the implementation
is the {@linkplain com.kis.testbed.controllers.TabbedFrameController} class.</p>
<p>
In this scenario, multiple frames (scenes) are carried in the various tabs.  There's a minimum of data to be
represented, so there is no formal 'document' or 'model' associated with the document frames, just a scene and
ui piece each.  Note specifically that the scene piece exclusively handles 3d/gl code, and that the ui piece
exclusively handles Swing code (or at least, that's the intent.)</p>
<p>
Since, in this scenario, the frames cannot be represented simultaneously, there is only one viewer that is
shared between them.  The viewer is held by the {@com.kis.testbed.SceneController} class, and is doled out
to a frame as it become active.  The viewer calls on the active scene to render its contents.</p>
<h2>Caveats, Further Directions</h2>
<p>
There's no attempt here to preserve state or even to mess with the camera - the problem I initially created
it to solve didn't have a need to do either.  Obviously, in a fully developed facility, these would be
further considerations.  Suggest each frame would have it's own derivation of the
{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.controllers.scene.SceneState} class which would maintain state for each frame.</p>
<p>
See the Kiosk and the Protein Workshop state mechanisms for some ideas on how this could be done.</p>
