<BODY>
This package provides classes which enable molecular biology data sets
(such as protein structures, sequence data, etc) to be loaded into an
MBT application as a {@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.Structure} object.
For example, the "getBatchStructure" method of the
{@link org.rcsb.mbt.structureLoader.StructureFactory} class could be called
in order to request that the default BatchStructureLoader implementation
should load a specified data set.
