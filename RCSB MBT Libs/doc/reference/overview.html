<p>
The Molecular Biology Toolkit (MBT) is a Java-based protein visualization and
analysis toolkit. The toolkit provides classes for efficiently loading,
managing and manipulating large amounts of protein structure and sequence data.</p>

<h1>Re-Architecting Effort</h1>
<p>
The MBT was originally written in JDK 1.0, before many well-accepted software
practices had been more formally defined, and before more efficient and type-safe
coding constructs were available in Java.</p>
<p>
In this revision, we have restructured key aspects of the architecture to follow
more clearly lines of architectural delineation, and to break out coding modules more
cleanly.  This has meant a re-structuring of the namespace &mdash; almost all of the packages
have been replaced/renamed to more accurately reflect their functional grouping.</p>
<p>
We have also endeavored to upgrade code usage to JDK 1.5 constructs in key areas.
Much remains to be done, but overall, the MBT is now poised to provide support
in a growing number of applications.</p>
<p>

Architecture Overview</a> page.

<H2>Usage Overview</H2>
<P>
The MBT software components were designed with efficiency and ease-of-use
in mind. In addition to the necessary data container objects,
file parsers, and basic data manipulation code, we wanted to supply the
developer with a set of high-level components which could be "plugged"
together to produce advanced programs with a minimal amount of user code.

<H2>MBT Data Model</H2>
<P>
The MBT data model is really quite simple. There is one parent data class
(the {@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureComponent} class) from which all other
data objects are derived (this class will be explained later). The top-level
container for a data-set is the {@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.Structure} class.
A {@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.Structure} provides access to a set of tables
of all sub-components (eg: {@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.Atom},
{@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.Residue}, etc). Each record is accessed with "array-like"
methods (eg: getStructureComponentCount and getStructureComponent).
