<BODY>
This package provides classes which enable molecular biology data
to be represented as visible/renderable viewable objects, plus,
this package defines a top-level StructureDocument object to encapsulate
the complete state of these objects and properties.
<P>
Each attribute object represents a visible/renderable encapsulation of
some subset of StructureComponent objects from a Structure, plus its
viewer-independant visual attributes (eg: color, size, etc).
