A full suite of geometrical manipulation utilities - matrices, vectors, etc.
<p>
Loaders, et al, sometimes need to apply various transformations to structure components,
particularly in biological unit and non-crystallographic construct generations.</p>
<p>
So, yes, this also forms the root of the 3d vector and matrice definitions used by the
3d scene visualization modules.  They are
here, so that the model can make use of it without bringing in the entire 3d scene
apparatus, for analytic or other type applications that don't render visualizations.</p>
<p>
An alternative might be to break these out in to their own jar available to the model
and to the 3d apps, but I don't want to get into to jar proliferation, if I can avoid it.
The model will always need it, 3d applications will always need the model, ergo the
model seems to be a the proper 'parent'.  That could change if we used a different
rendering package in which case we'd want to remove anything that looks gl specific
and put those back in the glscene module.</p>
<p>
I'm not going to worry about it too much, right now.</p>

Note: There is a certain amount of overlap between {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.geometry.Algebra}
and the rest, which are a bit more convenient to use.</p>
