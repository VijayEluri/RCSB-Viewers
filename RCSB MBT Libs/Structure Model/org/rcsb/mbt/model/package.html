<BODY>
	This package provides classes which define the core data storage
	containers for the MBT toolkit. Additional sub-packages
	provide the means to read/write, filter, manipulate, and view this data
	and its properties.
	<P>
	This is the core MBT package which implements the basic structure component
	data and property container classes, plus universal structure component
	identification and iteration mechanisms.
